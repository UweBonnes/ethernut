/*
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.8  2007/03/23 12:43:50  haraldkipp
 * ARP method wasn't actually disabled by default. Fixed.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2006/09/05 12:35:39  haraldkipp
 * DHCP servers may probe an IP/MAC relationship by sending an
 * ICMP request. This triggered the Nut/Net ARP method and
 * terminated the DHCP client, leaving the system with default
 * configurations of the network mask (255.255.255.0) and
 * default gateway (none). The rarely used ARP method is now
 * disabled by default.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2006/07/10 17:46:59  haraldkipp
 * Now really like Jan suggested to fix it.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2006/07/10 08:49:47  haraldkipp
 * Do not respond to broadcasts with unknown protocols. Many thanks to Jan.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2005/06/05 16:48:26  haraldkipp
 * Additional parameter enables NutUdpInput() to avoid responding to UDP
 * broadcasts with ICMP unreachable messages. Fixes bug #1215192.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2004/12/16 18:48:50  haraldkipp
 * Added Damian Slee's IP filter function.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2004/02/02 18:59:25  drsung
 * Some more ICMP support added.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2003/05/09 14:41:32  haraldkipp
 * Initial using 3.2.1
 *
 * Revision 1.16  2003/05/06 18:14:18  harald
 * Allow incoming DHCP telegrams, even if not broadcasted
 *
 * Revision 1.15  2003/03/31 12:26:05  harald
 * Accept masks with all bits set
 *
 * Revision 1.14  2003/02/04 18:14:57  harald
 * Version 3 released
 *
 * Revision 1.13  2002/06/26 17:29:36  harald
 * First pre-release with 2.4 stack
