 * \brief Configure a network interface.
 *
 * Devices must have been registered by NutRegisterDevice() before

 *
 * For Ethernet devices applications may alternatively call 
 * NutNetAutoConfig(), which allows automatic configuration by DHCP or 
 * the so called ARP method.
 *
 * \param name    Name of the device to configure.
 * \param params  Pointer to interface specific parameters. For PPP 
 *                interfaces this is a pointer to the PPP_PARAMS 
 *                structure. For Ethernet interfaces this parameter
 *                is ignored.
 * \param ip_addr Specified IP address in network byte order. This must 
 *                be a unique address within the Internet. If you do not 
 *                directly communicate with other Internet hosts, you can 
 *                use a locally assigned address. With PPP interfaces this
 *                may be set to 0.0.0.0, in which case the remote peer
 *                will be queried for an IP address.
 * \param ip_mask Specified IP network mask in network byte order.
 *                Typical Ethernet networks use 255.255.255.0, which 
 *                allows upto 254 hosts. For PPP interfaces 255.255.255.255
 *                is the default.
 *
 * \return 0 on success, -1 otherwise.
