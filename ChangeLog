2004-02-04  Oliver Schulz  <olischulz@web.de>

	* os/msg.c, include/sys/msg.h, os/Makefile: First version of message 
	queueing  implemented. Thanks to Ralph Mason, who provided this code. 
	Still contains some debug functions.


2004-02-02  Oliver Schulz  <olischulz@web.de>

	* include/net/if_var.h, net/ifconfig.c, pro/dhcp.c: Gateway ip 
	address was not set, if static network configuration from 
	EEPROM is used.

	* net/icmpin.c, net/icmpout.c, net/ipin.c, net/tcpsm.c, 
	include/sys/socket.h, include/netinet/icmp.h: Added some more ICMP 
	support. Now the network stack handles incoming ICMP unreachable 
	messages, and aborts appropiate TCP sockets.


2004-02-01  Harald Kipp  <harald.kipp@egnite.de>

	* include/compiler.h, os/timer.c, os/thread.c: Additional support 
	started for ARM7TDMI, H8/300 and Coldfire.

	* os/ctx_CPU.c: Split os/thread.c by CPU families.

	* os/tmr_CPU.c: Split os/timer.c by CPU families.

	* include/cpu/CPU.h: Split include/compiler.h by CPU families.


2004-01-30  Harald Kipp  <harald.kipp@egnite.de>

	* Version 3.4 release candidate.

	* appload/tftpd.c: Ethernut 2 bootloader failed to load
	files larger than 64kB.

	* net/ipcpin.c: Fixed a memory hole in case of incoming IPCP
	with bad identifiers.

	* net/lcpout.c: Added a parameter to LcpTxConfReq to handle
	rejected magic number requests. This is a dirty hack, but
	should help for now. All calls in lcpin.c and pppsm.c plus
	the prototype in include/netinet/if_ppp.h had been adapted as 
	well. Thanks to Alex Joni and Zoltan Korbai, who discovered
	this problem.


2004-01-30  Oliver Schulz  <olischulz@web.de>

	* include/dev/irqreg.h, include/dev/irqstack.h, dev/irqstack.c, 
	dev/ivect??.c, dev/Makefile: Separate interrupt stack for avr-gcc only 
	implemented. Size of this stack is 256 bytes. May be changed later. The 
	interrupt stack reduces the stack space needed for every thread, because 
	if an interrupt occurs, the stack pointer is immediately changed to the 
	interrupt stack and the thread stack is no longer used while executing 
	interrupt code.


2004-01-25  Oliver Schulz  <olischulz@web.de>

	* net/tcpsm.c: Bugfix for establishing tcp connections by
	calling NutTcpConnect. If no answer is received, retransmission
	is stoped after about 6 secs. If RST if received, the
	connection request is now properly aborted and the error is
	returned to the caller.


2004-01-14  Oliver Schulz  <olischulz@web.de>

	* pro/dhcpc.c, include/pro/dhcp.h: Applied changes by Damian
	Slee. Now it should be possible to obtain gateway and dns 
	server ip address from Win2k DHCP servers.
	
	* net/lcpin.c: Same bug fix like in IpcpRxConfReq applied
	also to LcpRxConfReq.
	
	* dev/lanc111.c: Speed improvements for transfering bytes
	from and to nic applied.
	
	* net/tcpsock.c: New TCP output buffering implemented. If not
	configured, it works nearly like the old buffering. To
	configure, use NutTcpSetSockOpt with new option SO_SNDBUF.
	
	* net/tcpsm.c: Now the retransmission timer is also 
	started on call of NutTcpConnect. 


2004-01-04  Oliver Schulz  <olischulz@web.de>

	* app/basemon/basemon.c: After adding thread termination
	support to Nut/OS, the priority of basemon's own idle
	thread was also changed from 255 to 254 to avoid idle thread
	termination.


2003-12-19  Oliver Schulz  <olischulz@web.de>

	* include/time.h, crt/time.c, crt/mktime.c, crt/gmtime.c
	crt/localtim.c: Dox written.


2003-12-18  Harald Kipp  <harald.kipp@egnite.de>

	* include/dev: Added missing usart driver include files.


2003-12-15  Harald Kipp  <harald.kipp@egnite.de>

	* os/version.c: Switched to 3.3.3, still preview.

	* os/thread.c: Long awaited support for terminating
	threads had been implemented. The context switch frame
	has been reduced to those registers, which really need
	to be saved. These most valuable changes had been
	contributed by Ralph Mason.

	* os/nutinit.c: Destroys terminated threads. Priority
	255 is used to terminate threads, thus the idle thread's
	priority changed from 255 to 254. This may break your
	existing application. Thanks again to Ralph Mason.

	* appicc: Imagecraft projects updated to version 6.29.

	* dev/usart.c: Hardware independant U(S)ART device driver
	added.

	* dev/usartavr.c: ATmega128/103 USART hardware support 
	for new usart.c. Includes HW/SW handshake, 9-bit and
	synchronous communication.

	* include/fcntl.h: Dox updated.

	* include/bankmem.h: Banking enabled with Ethernut 2.


2003-12-12  Oliver Schulz  <olischulz@web.de>

	* crt/putf.c: Rewritten support for strings stored in prgram
	space. Using still type character 'P', but also some heap
	to store the string in RAM before the output function is
	called.
	
	
2003-12-06  Oliver Schulz  <olischulz@web.de>

	* os/nutinit.c, os/init.c: Using __heap_start instead of
	__bss_end to support .noinit section under gcc.

	* os/nutinit.c: changed external RAM detection. Now it's
	possible to used more than 4KB static data under gcc.


2003-11-28  Harald Kipp  <harald.kipp@egnite.de>

	* net/tcpsm.c: TCP connections suddenly drop during 
	transmission. Bug in retransmission timer fixed.


2003-11-27  Oliver Schulz  <olischulz@web.de>

	* pro/dencode.c: Bug fix and code size improvement


2003-11-26  Oliver Schulz  <olischulz@web.de>

	* nutlibcrt.a: Added some standard C time functions to
	implement time handling and real time clocks.

	* pro/sntp.c: Added SNTP protocol to retreive universal
	coordinated time (UCT) from SNTP servers.

	* net/udpin.c, net/udpsock.h: Added a configurable receive
	packet queue for UDP packets.

	* crt/putf.c: Added support for program space character
	strings (%P).


2003-11-05  Harald Kipp  <harald.kipp@egnite.de>

	* Version 3.3.2

	* app/pppc.c: Added a note, that this will not work with
	ATmega103 chips as long as debugging is enabled, which
	requires a second UART.

	* dev/lanc111.c: Leftover from debugging set last byte
	of MAC address to 1.


2003-11-04  Harald Kipp  <harald.kipp@egnite.de>

	* All applications will work on Ethernut 1 and 2.

	* net/tcpsm.c: Race condition in TCP state machine left
	socket in CLOSE-WAIT state. Fixed.

	* app/basemon: Ignore PD5 in port test. Used with RS485.

	* dev/lanc111.c: Still link problems. Finally it should
	work now after correcting delays during PHY configuration.


2003-11-03  Harald Kipp  <harald.kipp@egnite.de>

	* app/isp2: New application to update the ISP adapter
	included in the Ethernut Starter Kit.

	* pro/dhcpc.c: Renewal disabled, if lease time is set 
	to zero

	* os/timer.c: New API function returns system uptime in 
	miliseconds. This function is now used by the TCP state
	machine to calculate retransmission timeouts. Another
	step towards round trip time calculation, which is
	still missing in Nut/Net.

	* include/compiler.h: New register types added for
	better portability to different MCU platforms.

	* dev/twif.c: Documentation of API calls enhanced.


2003-10-14  Harald Kipp  <harald.kipp@egnite.de>

	* tools/nutconf: New GUI configuration tool named nutconf.
	Based on the excellent wxWindows class library.

	* crt/icc: Imagecraft runtime initialization added to
	the CVS repository.


2003-10-13  Harald Kipp  <harald.kipp@egnite.de>

	* dev/lanc111.c: New driver for SMSC LAN91C111 provides
	100 Mbps Ethernet interface.

	* os/timer.c: Added a seconds counter.

	* pro/dhcpc.c: Replaced tick counter with seconds
	counter. This should fix the DHCP timer bug.

	NETBUFs will never be released if TCP is not used by
	application.

	* net/tcpsock.c: Another fix by Ralph, TCP may reuse
	socket ports because of wrong byte order during
	compare.


2003-08-07  Harald Kipp  <harald.kipp@egnite.de>

	* app/httpd/httpserv.c: Bugfix, remote not displayed
	in the socket list.

2003-08-05  Harald Kipp  <harald.kipp@egnite.de>
