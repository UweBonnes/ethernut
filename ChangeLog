	socket in CLOSE-WAIT state. Fixed.

	* app/isp2: New application to update the ISP adapter
	included in the Ethernut Starter Kit.

	to zero

	* os/timer.c: New API function returns system uptime in

	still missing in Nut/Net.

	* include/compiler.h: New register types added for
	better portability to different MCU platforms.

	* dev/twif.c: Documentation of API calls enhanced.

	NETBUFs will never be released if TCP is not used by
	application.

	* net/tcpsock.c: Another fix by Ralph, TCP may reuse
	socket ports because of wrong byte order during
	compare.
