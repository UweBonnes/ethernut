* Fixed:

Added HW_EFC_AT91 config provision to AT91 members with embedded flash 
controller.

* Changed:

Starting a new ChangeLog. What do you think about it?

Provision HW_NVMEM renamed to DEV_NVMEM, because the driver, not the
hardware supports this.

Moved all non-volatile memory options to the to the target independant 
driver.

* Added:

Support for Ethernut 3.1, including SPI bus controller based on Nut 
Programmable Logic.

More detailed documentation to the non-volatile memory parts in the
configuration scripts.

        * Mark documented deprecated functions with NUT_DEPRECATE.
          This will cause warnings during compilation if deprecated functions
          are used in user code.
