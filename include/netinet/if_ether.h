/*
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.6  2008/08/11 07:00:22  haraldkipp
 * BSD types replaced by stdint types (feature request #1282721).
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2008/07/14 13:10:30  haraldkipp
 * Added macros to determine Ethernet address types.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2006/08/01 07:41:01  haraldkipp
 * New functions ether_aton() and ether_ntoa() added. They convert the ASCII
 * representation of an Ethernet MAC address to its binary form and vice versa.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2005/04/05 17:38:45  haraldkipp
 * ARM7 memory alignment bugs fixed.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2004/03/16 16:48:28  haraldkipp
 * Added Jan Dubiec's H8/300 port.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2003/05/09 14:41:13  haraldkipp
 * Initial using 3.2.1
